Introduction
############

Acquisition of data from a variety of heterogeneous sources with precisely aligned timestamps is a requirement for many
kinds of in vivo experiments.
In addition, it is often necessary to manipulate experimental settings based on the animal's state or behavior,
and to store acquired data in a standardized format to simplify subsequent analysis.
To address these requirements, Syntalos exists.
It is capable of simultaneous acquisition of data from an arbitrary amount of sources,
including multi-channel electrophysiological recordings and different
types of live imaging devices.

At the same time, the program supports closed-loop, real-time interventions with
different actuators. Precisely matching timestamps for all inputs are ensured by continuous statistical analysis
and correction of the individual devices' timestamps and by use of the parallel-processing capabilities of
modern CPUs. New data sources can be integrated relatively easily as well, using Syntalos' module system.

All data generated from a given experiment is stored in a well-defined, comprehensive structure,
making it easy to compare, pool or share data between experimentalists with different research questions.
With these features, Syntalos enables reliable multi-modal recordings as well as closed-loop interventions
for many different (neuro)scientific questions.
