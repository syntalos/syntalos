Where did the Documentation go?
===============================

The documentation for Syntalos has largely been moved into a separate repository,
which allows us to update it easier and to include more and larger media files
without increasing the main repository size.

A lot of code documentation as well as assets are still coming from the main repository
though.
This directory contains some scaffolding that allow us to build the main documentation
on the [Syntalos Website](https://syntalos.org/)

Every new Syntalos module still needs to be documented!
You can find all the documentation texts and images at
[github.com/syntalos/syntalos-web](https://github.com/syntalos/syntalos-web) - please
file a pull request to add to the documentation or to improve it!
