Description: Synchronized DAQ from diverse sources and flexible experiment control
 Syntalos is a software for timestamp-synchronized parallel data acquisition
 from diverse data sources, such as cameras, microendoscopes,
 Intan electrophysiology amplifiers or Firmata-based serial interfaces.
 The software also allows closed-loop interventions via its built-in Python
 scripting support. It is specifically designed for use in (neuro)scientific
 in vivo behavior experiments.
